## Acknowledgments

- This project utilizes the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/api?lang=python) for generating unique meal titles and instructions. Special thanks to the teams behind these tools for the open source API. 
- The image generation feature uses the [Stable Diffusion v1-5 model](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) provided by Hugging Face. We thank them for offering such a comprehensive model that enhances the visual experience of this application.
- The food dataset used in this project is the [Food Ingredients and Recipes Dataset with Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images) by Sakshi Goel, sourced from the Epicurious website. This dataset contains 13k images and rows, providing a robust foundation for meal recommendations and search functionality.

## Important Note

**Please be aware** that this project contains sensitive API keys for the following services:

- **Gemini API**: Used for generating meal titles and instructions.
- **Hugging Face API**: Used for generating meal images via the Stable Diffusion model.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Used for storing user information, including passwords and favorite meals.

These keys are integral to the functioning of the application. **However, they should not be used for any purposes outside of this project.** Unauthorized use or abuse of these keys could lead to security risks, financial costs, or the disabling of the API access.

If you fork or clone this repository, **please ensure to replace the API keys with your own,** or remove them entirely if not needed. 

**Responsible usage of these resources is highly encouraged.**
